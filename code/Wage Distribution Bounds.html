<h1 align="center"> Wage Distribution Bounds</h1>
<p>
The following link contains matlab code and data to implement the worst-case and IV bounds on wage CDFs reported in Ho and Rosen (2016): "Partial Identification in Applied Research: Benefits and Challenges", Section 6.2. To run the code as is, execute "CDF-Bound-Script" from the Matlab prompt in a folder containing the unzipped files. The files can additionally be modified to produce bounds at different values of the exogenous variables, as well as under different parameters for the underlying data generation process.
